What is DataViz?

DataViz is a documentary platform created by a group of three MMI students.
Data are represented in the form of graphic visualization, the Dataviz team invites you to discover them!

Most of the results of the case studies conducted around social networks show a strong growth in the general use of the latter, which can be explained by a fashion effect but also by an external factor such as Covid19, which has notably incited people from all over the world to gather around media platforms to be able to preserve social links. If the development of digital solutions is essentially based on the relational aspect in a global context, social networks also seduce by their entertaining and engaging aspect, as well as for the fast and real time diffusion of diverse and varied contents.

Some data have been taken from reliable sites whose professional sector revolves around digital and more generally around media, others have been calculated from these data (ie. Evolution rate). The sharing of this information is given for information purposes as part of a student project.
